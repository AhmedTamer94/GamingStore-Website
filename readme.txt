this is my first try to clone gaming websites such as steam and epic games.

I used back-end and front-end technologies to build this website using:

1- node.js

2-mongodb.

3-bootstrap5 lib.

4- making a small web application to add games data and store to the data base using post method.

5- the data base connected to local mongodb server and further in future i'll modify in it to connect to atlas server.

6- i installed mongoose to try to connect to atals server but it has no current use in this application.

7- you will need to re-install node modules before running the application
