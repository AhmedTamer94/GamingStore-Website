Jill Valentine and the other surviving S.T.A.R.S. members try to make this truth known, but find that the police department itself is under Umbrella's sway and their reports are rejected out of hand.  However, soon reports of a grisly \"cannibal virus\" begin to surface, and vicious dogs begin roaming the streets.
